## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'us_presidents'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install us_presidents

## Usage

User is greeted with a welcome message and an image of the US flag. A list of all US presidents is displayed. The user is prompted to select one president by typing the index number associated with the selected president. Once a president is selected, a brief information is provided to the reader. The user is prompted with an option to read additional details about the president. Once the user responds with a 'YES', more details are displayed to the user about the selected president. Reader has a choice to either list the presidents again or exit the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
